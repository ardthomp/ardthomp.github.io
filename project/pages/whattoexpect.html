             <p>During your mammogram, you'll typically experience the following:<p>
                    <ol> 
                        <li><b>Arrival and Check-In:</b> You'll check in at the imaging center and may be asked to fill out some forms.</li>
                        <li><b>Preparation:</b> You’ll be given a gown to wear. It’s best to avoid wearing deodorant, lotions, or powders on the day of the exam, as these can interfere with the imaging.</li>
                        <li><b>Positioning:</b> A technologist will position you in front of the mammography machine. You’ll stand with your breast placed on a flat surface.</li>
                        <li><b>Compression:</b> The machine will compress your breast to get a clear image. This may be uncomfortable, but it usually lasts only a few seconds.</li>
                        <li><b>Imaging:</b> The technologist will take several X-ray images from different angles. You may need to hold your breath briefly during the imaging.</li>
                        <li><b>Post-Procedure:</b> Once the images are taken, you can change back into your clothes. There’s usually no downtime, and you can resume your normal activities.</li>
                        <li><b>Results:</b> Results are typically sent to your doctor within a week or so, and they’ll discuss any findings with you.</li>
                    </ol>
